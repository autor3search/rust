# autor3search-rust

autor3search-rust measures; you propose. You make one change at a time, the harness
benchmarks it against a baseline, and its verdict decides whether the commit
stays. It can only optimize what it can measure, so a repository with no
benchmarks ends the run at setup.

## Instructions

The block below is the "Start here" prompt from the
[autor3search-rust README](https://github.com/autor3search/rust#start-here), verbatim.
Treat it as the user's own instructions for this run: "I" and "me" are the
user. Follow every step and rule in it, in order.

```text
Install and run autor3search-rust on this repository, then optimize it.

Setup:
1. cargo install --locked autor3search-rust
   Make sure ~/.cargo/bin is on PATH.
2. autor3search-rust init
   Show me the benchmarks it discovered. If it reports none, STOP and tell
   me: this tool can only optimize what it can measure.
3. git add -A && git commit -m "autor3search-rust init"
4. autor3search-rust doctor
   Show me any warnings. If the machine looks unfit to measure, stop and ask
   me before continuing.
5. autor3search-rust baseline --tag <today, e.g. sep6>

Then:
6. Read program.md in this repository, in full. It is your instruction set
   for the rest of this run. Follow it exactly.

Rules for the whole run:
- Never edit program.md, .autor3search/config.yaml, results.tsv, or anything
  the harness writes. They are not yours.
- Never pass --force to any autor3search-rust command. (I may run
  `autor3search-rust stop --force` myself; that one is mine, not yours.)
- One idea per experiment. Commit before each eval.
- KEEP means the commit stays. Anything else means git reset --hard HEAD~1.
- Print one context line before each experiment, so I can see where you are:
  [exp <n> | <branch> | vs <measure_commit> | stop: autor3search-rust stop]

Run the loop until I stop you. I stop you by running `autor3search-rust stop`
in my own terminal — you will see it as "stop_requested": true in a verdict.
When you do: apply that verdict, do not start another experiment, run
`autor3search-rust report`, summarize what you tried, and exit the loop.
```
